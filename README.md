**README: SHELL 2**

Structure: 

In addition to the functions implemented in shell 1, our shell implements the following functions.

Ignoring and resetting signals: When the shell is first run, the signals SIGINT (control-C), SIGTSTP (control-Z), and SIGTTOU (a backgorund process attempting to write to stdout) are ignored, so that of the user attempts to input these commands, they don't work. Then once fork is called and a child process is created, each of these signals is set back to its default so that the child process does not ignore the signals and treats them normally. When each signal is ignored, an error messges prints if ignoring the signal failed.

Handling background processes: If an ampersand is included at the end of the entered commands with a space before it, the argv and tokens array receive that as its last index. If the ampersand is in the argv array, the is_bg boolean is set to true. Once built-in commands are checked for, non-built-in commands are handled, in which terminal control between foreground and background processes it set. Once fork is called, terminal control is given to the child process created as a result of fork if the is_bg boolean is false, meaning the ampersand was not included in the input and the process should be run in the foreground. 
If the process should be run in the background and the is_bg boolean is true, terminal control remains with the shell. Outside of the child process, background processes are then added to the jobs list and assigned a jid and pid. Foreground processes are waited on by using waitpid, which takes in the foreground's pid so know which process to wait for, and returns the process's pid. The predefined macros WIFSTOPPED (if the process is stopped/paused) and WIFSIGNALED (if the process is temrinated by a signal) are then checked to determine if either of these things happened to the foreground process. If the foreground process is stopped, it is added to the jobs list and a message is printed to stdout (whatever that may be set as). If the foreground process is terminated by a signal, a message is printed to atdout (again whatever that may be set as). Finally, temrinal control is set to actually remain with the shell, as mentioned above.

Reaping: At the end of the main function, before the next prompt is printed (if running with the PROMPT macro), waitpid is called in a while loop, so that all background processes are reaped before allowing the user to enter anther input. For every iteration of the loop, the returned pid and status is passed into the reap function. In the reap function, each predefined macro determining the process's status is checked: WIFCONTINUED (if a background process is continued), WIFEXITED (if a background process is terminated normally), WIFSIGNALED (if a background process is terminated by a signal), and WIFSTOPPED (if a background process is stopped/paused). For WIFCONTINUED, the job is updated with the RUNNING enum in the job list and a message is printed that the action was completed. For WIFEXITED, a messsage is printed that the action was successful and then job is removed from the job list. For WIFSIGNALED, a message is printed that the action was successful and the job is removed from the job list. For WIFSTOPPED, the job is updated with the STOPPED enum in the job list and a message is printed that the action was successful. This function then returns and is continually called in the while loop until all background proccesses are reaped, so that the prompt can then be printed again. FInally, every time the program exits, the cleanup function for the jobs list is called to free up memory that was previously allocated to processes running in the background.

Handling changing grounds: If the "fg" or "bg" command is entered into the shell, it is treated as a built in commands because we don't want to fork into a child process if the input is to change the location of a process. In the function that handles built-in commands, if the first index in the argv array is "fg" or "bg" and the next index in the array isn't null, meaning the entry also includes a process to move, the  function to change processes' locations is called. Within this function, the process's jid is determined from the argv array and the pid from the jid. The jid is then checked to make sure it correlates to a process that is indeed in the jobs list (and a mesage is printed if it isn't). 
If the process is to be moved to the foreground, it is given terminal control and killed, so that the process is continued with the correct terminal control (in this case it has terminal control). Waitpid is then called because we must wait for this process to terminated as it is now a foreground process. WIFEXITED, WIFSTOPPED, and WIFSIGNALED are checked for and handled as described above in reaping. 
If the process is to be moved to the background, the job is updated in the jobs list with the running enum and killed, so that the process is continued with the correct terminal control (in this case it does not have terminal control).
If the "jobs" commans is entered into the shell, it is treated as a built in command because again, we don't want to fork into a child process if the input is to run the built-in jobs command. In the function that handles built-in commans, if the first index in the argv array is "jobs," the jobs function is called to print out the current jobs.

Known bugs: none

Extra implementations: none

How to compile: run the "make clean all" command to updateto current version of code and run the "/.33sh" command with or without the PROMPT macro to enter the shell.

Distribution of work: 

Grace: makefile, fg/bg command setup
Ishika: reaping debugging, jobs command
Together: ignoring and resetting signals, running processes in bg, reaping setup, rest of fg/bg command
